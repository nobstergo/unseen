# Unseen

**Unseen** keeps players hidden until they're close enough to each other. It blocks tablist visibility, silences join/quit/death messages, and removes tab completion to keep sneaky vibes strong

---

## Features
- Players only see each other within a configurable distance (default 20 blocks)
- Suppresses join, quit, and death messages for stealth vibes
- Disables player name tab completion in chat so no spoilers
- Keeps the online player list a secret unless you physically spot 'em

---

## Dependency
